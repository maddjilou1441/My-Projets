# 2 Data_challenge_on_kernel_methods

The motivation of this data-challenge project is to practice what we did in the Kernel Methods AMMI 2020 for machine learning.
The way we do the practice is to classify a data set about transcription factor. During this classification task we should predict whether a DNA sequence region 
is binding site to a specific transcription factor.
Transcription factors (TFs) are regulatory proteins that bind specific sequence motifs in the genome to activate or repress transcription of target genes.
Genome-wide protein-DNA binding maps can be profiled using some experimental techniques and thus all genomics can be classified into two classes for a TF of interest: 
bound or unbound.
In this challenge, we will work with three datasets corresponding to three different TFs.
For that, we have been provided 2000 data sample data labeled to learn our model which should be able to classifies as possible as 1000 sample unlabled.
